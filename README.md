# More Elites

**SUBMIT ANY ISSUES USING THE LINK ABOVE**

There's a config for disabling specific elites. Some crown displays might be wonky.

## Tier 1

### Volatile (RoR1)

-

## Tier 2

Position DOES matter when adding the array, so if it doesn't look quite how you like, experiment with swapping positions of the colors.

### Echo

- Spawns 2 clones of itself with 10% max HP and full damage
- Clones die if main body is killed

Tier 2

    Shielding: Has a bubble shield that protects itself and allies
    Hemorrhaging: Intermittently creates a sphere near a target, predictive placement, initial explosion damage and stacks bleed the longer you're in it. (could be any debuff really or a random one)

Tier 1

    Temporal: Intermittently blinks short distances around itself (random node in a sphere around itself)
    Anchor: Makes 3? nearby allies immune
    Parasitic: On attack hit (if it misses create a trap fly that attaches if you get in the zone), attach a beetle queen fly to the target in the zone, it has to be destroyed else it keeps stacking beetle juice (fly HP would be a % of the elite's HP and have a base amount if their HP is too low)
    Conduit: Turns immune at an HP threshold(s) and forms a destructible orb (HP based on monster HP) that follows it, destroying it removes immunity.
    Juggernaut: Immune to stun/freeze/slow
